	//// when we declare the variable 'a' we are telling the compiler
	//// to create this variable in an area of memory called the 'stack'. Stack 
	//// variables are sometimes referred to as 'local variables' because they
	//// only exist within a certain scope (more on scope later)
	//int a;

	//// variables on the 'stack' can hold any predefined type, including pointers
	//// so we can also declare pointers on the stack like so...
	//int* b;

	//// You have already seen how you can assign a variable on the stack to a value
	//// with the assignment operator '='. Here we assign the stack variable 'a' to 
	//// hold the value 100
	//a = 100;

	//// The 'new' keyword allows us to allocate memory on something called 
	//// the 'heap' instead of the 'stack'. The keyword 'new' is provided by C++ 
	//// to handle the creation of variables on the 'heap' for us. In order to use
	////'new' you must specify the type of variable to create so that the compiler
	//// knows how much memory to allocate on the 'heap'. Using 'new' also 'returns' 
	//// the memory address where the newly allocated memory is located, so you must
	//// assign the result of 'new' to a pointer type. The type of pointer will usually 
	//// match the type of memory allocated. 
	//b = new int;

	//// Now we have a pointer to an integer called 'b' which points to an address	
	//// located in 'heap' memory. We say the pointer 'b' exists on the stack but the 
	//// memory pointed to by 'b' exists on the heap
	//cout << "The pointer b points to the memory address " << b << " located on the heap\n";

	//// After calling 'new' the memory is initialised to zero
	//// and we can verify this by dereferencing the pointer b	
	//cout << "The value in memory location b is " << *b << "\n";

	//// If we want to assign the newly created 'heap' memory to a value we
	//// must dereference pointer 'b' and assign it to an integer value
	//*b = a;

	//// Now the area of 'heap' memory pointed to by 'b' contains a copy of the value
	//// assigned to the stack variable 'a'. Two memory locations contain the value 
	//// 100, one on the stack and the other on the heap 
	//cout << "The value of stack variable a is " << a << "\n";
	//cout << "The 'heap' memory pointed to by b contains " << *b << "\n";

	//// The memory containing 'stack' variables is automatically 'released' 
	//// when the program execution leaves their 'scope'. Variables allocated on the
	//// 'heap' however are not automatically released like 'stack' variables. 
	//// it is very important that the programmer releases 'heap' memory when finished
	//// with it or else the memory cannot be reused and a 'memory leak' will be created. 
	//// C++ provides the keyword 'delete' for this task which expects a pointer to 
	//// a memory address on the 'heap'...
	//delete b;

	//// when delete it called on a pointer variable it is good programming practise
	//// to set the pointer to NULL. If you subsequently try to access a pointer that 
	//// has been 'freed' with 'delete' you will probably cause your program to crash
	//b = NULL;

	//// having reached the end of the function, the stack variables 'int a' and 'int* b'
	//// will be automatically released. If you had not released the 'heap' memory previously
	//// pointed to by 'b' it would have be lost for the duration of the program execution
	//// always remember to free memory allocated with 'new' once you are finished with it,
	//// by calling 'delete' on the pointer which points to it! 
	//return 0;
