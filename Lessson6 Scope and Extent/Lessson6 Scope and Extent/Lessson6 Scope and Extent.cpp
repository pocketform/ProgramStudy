#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// C++ programs incorporate the notion of 'scope' and 'extent'. Scope creates 
// hierachical divisions between different sections of any C++ program, limiting 
// the extent of named variables within that scope. 
//
// One form of scope we have already seen exists with functions. The 
// extent (or existence) of local-variables is limited to the scope of a 
// function which we create using curly brackets {} at the beginning and at 
// the end of any function we define
//
void some_function()
{ // beginning of function scope

  // stack variables declared within a function only exist for the duration 
  // of its execution...
	int a = 400;
	char letter = 'b';

} // end of function scope 

  // We can declare global variables in C++ whose scope extends to the entire cpp file
  // Global variables exist for the duration of the program's execution
int global_variable = 50;

int main()
{ //entering the scope of the main function

  // we are now in the scope of main, but we still have access to 'global_variable'. 
  // Global scope encompasses the scope of main, which means we can (usually) access 
  // variables from an encompassing scope...
	cout << "global variable contains the value " << global_variable << "\n";

	// Here we have the declaration of an integer variable 'a' and a pointer to an 
	// integer 'b' which are local to the scope of the main function. We will use these
	// to demonstrate the effects of scope and extent.
	int a = 100;
	int* b;

	// We can create a scoped block of code by inserting curly brackets
	// within a function. As with functions, we initiate a scoped-block with
	// the opening-bracket { and close it with the closing-bracket }
	{

		// on this line we have progressed from the scope of the main function to the scope
		// created by the opening-bracket. Note that 'scope' is hierarchical and an 'inner' 	
		// scope exists solely within the brackets of an 'outer' scope.

		// Notice now the 'extent' of stack-variables declared within a refined scope. 
		// Here we declare another variable called 'a' whose extent is limited to 	 
		// this local-scope (within the curly brackets). The naming of variable 'a' does not 	
		// cause a conflict with the previous variable 'a' declared outside this scope
		int a = 200;

		// when we output its value we see that it is 200
		cout << "the value in a is " << a << "\n";

		// if we allocate memory on the heap here we must be sure to release it before we leave this scope. 
		// (here we are using a constructor () to initialise the heap memory to the value 300; more on 
		// constructors later)
		int* local_ptr = new int(300);

		// Alternatively, we can use another pointer which will exist beyond the current scope to 
		// ensure the memory is not lost, the pointer 'b' for instance will continue to exist beyond this
		// scope...
		b = local_ptr;

	}

	// now we have returned to the scope of main function and any variables created
	// in the inner-scope no longer exist. We can see this by printing the value of 
	// variable 'a'. Note that the output shows 100. 
	cout << "the value in a is " << a << "\n";

	// the variable local_ptr has ceased to exist, but because we stored the memory address
	// in 'b' we can still access (and release) the heap memory allocated
	cout << "the value pointed to by 'b' is " << *b << "\n";
	delete b;
	b = NULL;

	// In C++ we also have something called the 'scope operator' denoted by a double colon :: 	
	// which comes into use with namespaces. We have already seen the command to tell the
	// compiler which namespace(s) we wish to use: 'using namespace std;'. This allows us to 
	// write 'cout' without the need to provide the namespace 'std' where the 'cout' function 
	// is defined. However, we could also have used the fully qualified expression...
	std::cout << "output some data" << "\n";

	// finally, when the program enters a function, the scope changes again to that of the local 
	// function. Although the function can reference global variables, the variables 'a' and 'b' 
	// will not be known to the function's local-scope. In this case we must 'pass' the variables
	// 'a' and 'b' to the function as parameters, if the function requires access to them (more on 
	// this in the next lesson)
	some_function();

	int ok = 11;
	{
		int ok = 22;
		cout << ok << "\n";
	}

	cout << ok << "\n";

	int exit;

	cin >> exit;

	return 0;
